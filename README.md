# Smart-Agriculture--Crop-Prediction

Modern agriculture faces significant challenges in optimizing crop yields, managing resources efficiently, and adapting to changing environmental conditions. This project proposes a Smart Agricultural Production Optimizing Engine that leverages the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide data-driven insights and predictions for improving agricultural practices. By analyzing historical datasets, including weather patterns, soil quality, and crop yields, the engine generates predictive models to recommend optimal actions such as crop selection and resource allocation. The project focuses exclusively on computational analysis, avoiding reliance on IoT or real-time sensor data, making the solution cost-effective and scalable. The system is designed to enhance decision-making processes for farmers and agricultural managers, ultimately improving productivity and sustainability in farming.

Models used- 
1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. SVM

Fuzzy logic was applied to the dataset to identify various patterns, and clusters were formed based on these patterns to group similar data points. After experimenting with different configurations, we found that using five clusters provided the optimal balance between complexity and accuracy for this dataset. These clusters enabled the development of specific fuzzy rules to predict the most suitable crops for given environmental conditions. 
The use of fuzzy logic in this analysis allowed the model to handle uncertainty and imprecision more effectively compared to traditional approaches. The dynamic nature of the fuzzy rules, which varied according to the cluster size, offered significant flexibility in decision-making. By clustering the data into five groups, the model was able to capture subtle relationships between environmental factors and crop suitability. This approach provided more nuanced predictions, especially in cases where inputs were imprecise or uncertain, which can be challenging for other models. The adaptability of fuzzy logic made the model more robust and capable of operating across a wide range of environmental conditions and crop types, improving its overall predictive performance.
